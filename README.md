Negli René Gallardo Alvarado (Gallardo, N)
Guatemalan

Professional summary

I am a Guatemalan Health Sciences Ph.D. student deeply interested in researching the association between the social determinants of health inequalities and fecundity. Before becoming a Ph.D. student, I had more than seven years of professional experience in research, monitoring, and evaluation activities. For five years, my professional work focused on the monitoring and evaluation of sexual and reproductive health projects in Central America and the Caribbean. As a professional and student, I have been passionate about studying social issues related to inequality and seeking their solution through high-quality public policies. Therefore, I strongly believe in social research applied to health as a means to achieve social justice.
